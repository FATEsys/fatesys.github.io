# The FATEsys Workshop

With the advent of IoT, high performance computing, and ubiquitous and smart sensing, the SenSys/BuildSys community is noticing a big shift in the adoption of data-driven black-box modeling (also referred to as AI) to solve problems in the space of smart environments and energy systems. As a result, these AI-enabled systems for smart buildings, smart cities, smart grids, electric transportation, among others are attaining better accuracy and efficiency numbers every year. However, these data-driven black-box solutions are rarely held accountable for the impact of their actions on the human in the loop which significantly impacts their real-world adoption. To truly conceptualize the idea of smart systems for everyone, it is critical to study AI-enabled smart environments and energy systems to enforce energy equity and ensure not just clean and resilient energy systems, but also make them affordable and accessible for all. The **ACM SIGEnergy workshop on Fair, Accountable, Transparent, and Ethical AI for Smart Environments and Energy Systems** intends to bring together researchers from diverse backgrounds and discuss key issues, challenges, breakthroughs, and socio-economic impact in developing fair, accountable, transparent and ethical AI techniques for smart environments and energy systems.
